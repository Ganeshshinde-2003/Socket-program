# Socket Program using Python
This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates socket programming. The program uses Python's built-in socket module to create a client-server connection, allowing for communication between two separate processes on a network.

## To run the program, follow these steps::

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

          `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/socket-program.git`

2. Navigate to the cloned directory using the command line.
3. Run the server program by executing the following command:

          `python server.py`
          
4. Open a separate terminal window and run the client program by executing the following command:

          `python client.py`
          
5. Follow the prompts in the client program to send and receive messages to and from the server.

This program demonstrates the basics of socket programming using Python. You can modify and build on this program to create your own custom client-server communication solution.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Built-in socket module
